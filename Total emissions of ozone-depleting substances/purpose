Ozone-depleting substances (chlorines and bromines) can be emitted from natural and anthropogenic (man-made) sources. In the chart below we see emissions of ozone-depleting substances from 1960 onwards. This is measured in tonnes of chlorofluorocarbon-11-equivalents (CFC11 equivalents). CFC11 equivalents is a standardized measure to normalise the sum of a range of ozone-depleting substances to a value equivalent to their potential to deplete ozone;
